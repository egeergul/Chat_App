This is a project for me to learn the MERN stack. MERN stands for
* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Node.js

In this project, the frontend side (client folder) uses React, and Axios to communicate with the server.

The backend side of the project (server folder) uses Express and Node.js. As an online database, I used MongoDB. To manage the MongoDB, mongoose is being used in the project.

# Installation
The application can be installed and used by downloading the repository. One has to ru both of the commands in both of the directories (in client and in server)

## npm install
The necessary dependencies can be downloaded with the npm install command. You need to run this command under both the client and the server folders.

## npm start
To run the application, run npm start command under both the client and the server folders. Prefer to start the server folder first.
